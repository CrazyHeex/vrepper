# vrepper

Tethered V-REP in Python.

The Python binding (`vrep.py` and friends) and the driver libraries (`remoteApi.dll` and `remoteApi.dylib`) is copied as-is from V-REP PRO EDU V3.4

## How to

```bash
$ ipython hello.py
```

The command above will start V-REP and run a simple simulation step-by-step. Then it will shut itself down and exit.
